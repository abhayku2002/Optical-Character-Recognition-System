# Optical-Character-Recognition-System

optical character recognition (OCR) is most 
successful with constrained material, such as documents 
produced under controlled conditions. However, the future 
demand for constrained OCR is expected to decrease. This 
is because control over the production process often 
means the document originates from material already 
stored on a computer. If a computer-readable version is 
available, data can be exchanged electronically or printed 
in a more computer-readable form, such as barcodes. 
Future OCR systems will be vital for recognizing 
documents where control over the production process is 
impossible. This includes material where the recipient 
lacks access to an electronic version and has no control 
over the production process, or older material that 
couldn't be generated electronically at the time of 
production. Consequently, future OCR systems designed 
for reading printed text must be omnifont. Operational 

Character Recognition improves productivity, accuracy, 
and accessibility by transforming handwritten, printed, or 
image-based text into machine-readable and editable 
formats.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
There are numerous printed books and newspapers on a 
variety of topics. The difficulty here is getting software to 
identify characters in the computer system when 
information is scanned through paper materials. Every 
time we scan a document using a scanner, the document is 
saved in the computer system as an image (jpeg, gif, etc.). 
The user is unable to read or alter these images. However, 
it is quite challenging to read each section separately and 
do a word-by-word and line-by-line search of these 
documents' contents in order to reuse this 
information."Storing the information available in these 
paper documents into a computer storage disk and later 
editing or reusing this information by searching process" is 
a highly sought-after practice these days. The persistent 
shortcomings of OCR technology have significant effects on 
accessibility and data management. Errors in important 
data, inefficiencies in information retrieval, and a rise in 
the amount of manual labor required for data correction 
might result from inaccurate text recognition. These 
difficulties can lead to operational hiccups and decreased 
productivity in industries like legal and financial services, 
which mostly depend on precise document processing.
Document layouts can range greatly, from 
straightforward single-column designs to intricate 
multi-column arrangements that include a variety of 
material, including annotations, tables, and photos. Many 
of the OCR systems in use today are not capable of 
handling complex layouts or document formats. This 
limitation is especially noticeable for documents with 
irregular formatting, embedded graphics, or non-linear 
text layouts, as they can result in inaccurate or partial text 
extraction.
