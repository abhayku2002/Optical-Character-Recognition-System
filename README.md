# Optical-Character-Recognition-System

optical character recognition (OCR) is most 
successful with constrained material, such as documents 
produced under controlled conditions. However, the future 
demand for constrained OCR is expected to decrease. This 
is because control over the production process often 
means the document originates from material already 
stored on a computer. If a computer-readable version is 
available, data can be exchanged electronically or printed 
in a more computer-readable form, such as barcodes. 
Future OCR systems will be vital for recognizing 
documents where control over the production process is 
impossible. This includes material where the recipient 
lacks access to an electronic version and has no control 
over the production process, or older material that 
couldn't be generated electronically at the time of 
production. Consequently, future OCR systems designed 
for reading printed text must be omnifont. Operational 

Character Recognition improves productivity, accuracy, 
and accessibility by transforming handwritten, printed, or 
image-based text into machine-readable and editable 
formats.
